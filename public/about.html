<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Saravana. I am a Civil Engineer turned IT Professional. I am a Web Developer by passion. I am a Certified Adobe Professional. Working as an Administrator in Adobe Workfront. Have worked in top organisations like Adobe, UST Global, HCL, etc. 
  I have around 4 years of experience in Tech industry. I also have good knowledge in Linux Administration, HTML, CSS, JS, React, Python and Adobe Fusion. </p>

<p>Being a post graduate in Construction Management, the reason why came into this field is because of the interest in softwares and the intension to learn throughout my entire life. Please don't think I am blaming my previous field, but I feel the learning was limited there and the routine work involves there is to do the same work again and again which was really boring for me and I lost all my interest to work there. Then due to curiosity, I went through some Online course about Python and gradually I saw my interest got increased exponentially for learning new things and implementing it in real.</p>

<p>I got an entry in to this industry by learning Adobe Workfront which is new tool in the market and the resources who knows it will be rare. I got selected in UST Global and soon I got certification in that too. Now after coming into this industry, I feel energetic each and every day and I am enjoying working in this industry. Putting on consistent efforts and hardwork, I feel I will succeed in this industry and will be in a good position soon.</p>
<p>If you ask about one goal in my life, It would be "A LIFE TIME LEARNING" which is my biggest motivation factor.</p>
